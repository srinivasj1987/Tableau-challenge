## Data Preparation
The csv were combined using a python code. This code is present in the folder data under combining_csv.ipynb. This generates a data that is close to 980k records. The level of information is sufficient to understand trends.

## Analysis
### 1. Total number of ridex
People seem to ride more bikes in the summer than in the winter. The possible reason could be that people are not willing to ride outside in winter due to the cold weather.
December 2022 had the lowest number of records, while August 2022 had the highest number of records.
The maximum increase in % for number of rides was seen for the month of April and the lowest % was December. This may be largely due to the weather.
